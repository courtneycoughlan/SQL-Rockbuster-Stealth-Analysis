Create subqueries to answer complex business questions targeting specific groups:

SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country,
AVG(E.amount) AS average,
(SELECT SUM(E.amount)) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
WHERE country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation',
'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
AND city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya',
'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, city, country
ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5



SELECT D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.country) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
